    <h3>Activity 1</h3>
    <p><strong>Iot Applications</strong> is known for the exchange of data between software and hardware with the support of internet. To examplify, we have smart homes, smart grids and some smart cars like <em>Tesla</em>.  Moreover, we discussed about the required features like connectivity, sensing, integration, etc.</p>

    <h3>Activity 2</h3>
    <p>What does <strong>smart</strong> actually means is the technique which is quite efficient in completing work quickly and smartly. Features needed are better algorithm, database for storing data as well as better time management is quite crucial. For smart building scenario there should be the interection between people, system and the environment.</p>

    <h3>Activity 3</h3>
    <p>In this activity we discussed about <strong>high level features</strong> where we came to know that the control interface reflects the device that is being controlled by and the function of assistive technology.</p>

    <h3>List of IoT applications</h3>
    <p>Here are some of the IoT applications:</p>
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Wearables</li>      
      <li>Health</li>
      <li>Trafic monitoring</li>
      <li>Agriculture</li>
      <li>Water supply</li>

    </ul>
